The best known of all periodic comets, Halley’s Comet visits the inner solar system every 75-76 years. The comet was the first to have its orbit calculated by Sir Edmond Halley, who predicted the return of the great comet in 1759. Famously, American author Mark Twain was born in 1835 during the passage of Halley’s Comet and predicted he would “expect to go out with it,” which he promptly did in 1910. A fleet of international space probes visited the comet in 1986, and it will next grace Earth’s skies in 2061.
