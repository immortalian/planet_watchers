*Makemake* (minor-planet designation 136472 Makemake) is a dwarf planet and perhaps the largest Kuiper belt[e] object in the classical population,[a] with a diameter approximately two thirds that of Pluto.[19][20] Makemake has one known satellite, S/2015 (136472) 1.[21] Makemake's extremely low average temperature, about 30 K (−243.2 °C), means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices.[16]
